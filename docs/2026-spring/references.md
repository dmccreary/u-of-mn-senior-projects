### A Five-Level Classification Framework for Intelligent Textbooks

**Author:** Dan McCreary

**Date:** November 30, 2025

**URL:** https://osf.io/preprints/edarxiv/sh2yu_v1

This preprint proposes a classification framework for intelligent textbooks inspired by the SAE J3016 standard for autonomous vehicles. The five levels range from static content (Level 1) through interactive simulations (Level 2), adaptive learning (Level 3), chatbot integration (Level 4), to fully autonomous AI tutoring (Level 5). The framework helps educators and developers set appropriate goals for their projects.
