# University of Minnesota Spring Semester Senior Design Project

The Electrical Engineering and Computer Design department at the University of Minnesota teachers a Senior Design course each Spring Semester.  This year, I have been asked to mentor four students
for a project that I submitted to [Sharat Bhatra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharatbatra/) last fall.
