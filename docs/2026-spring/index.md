# University of Minnesota Spring Semester Senior Design Project

The Electrical Engineering and Computer Design department at the University of Minnesota teachers a Senior Design course each Spring Semester.  This year, I have been asked to mentor four students for a project that I submitted to [Sharat Bhatra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharatbatra/) last fall.

## Book Assignments

Although we would like everyone to work together on all the books we generate,
we will be assigning one primary book for each student.  Sharat would
like one of you to work on the Circuits textbook and one person to work
on a Digital Electronics textbook.

We also want each student to play the role of a "Product Manager" in this program.  You will meet with users of the textbook and determine what features of the textbook are most
important and what order they should be added.

My role will be to help you understand what a product manager does in the age of AI.
I will help you get Claude setup, but after that Claude will be able to answer
technical questions better than I can.

Once you get Claude Code installed, you will be asked to log your sessions into log files so we can look back and see what design decisions Claude made on your textbook and
designing your MicroSims.

## Reference Material

You can see sample textbooks here:

[Case Studies of Intelligent Textbooks](https://dmccreary.github.io/intelligent-textbooks/case-studies/) - there are about 60 and we are getting a new textbook every week.

[MicroSim Search](https://dmccreary.github.io/search-microsims/search/demo.html) - there are about 830 MicroSims and we are getting about 30 new MicroSims each week.
