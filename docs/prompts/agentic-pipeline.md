# Agentic Pipeline

!!! prompt
    I want to build intelligent textbook centered around a learning graph in a graph database.  I have many prompts that I use with generative AI LLMs to create and 
    refine these concept dependency graphs (DAGs) from course descriptions to enumerated concepts for the course to the DAGs.  How can I automate this with a local LLM on a GPU.  My language is Python.
