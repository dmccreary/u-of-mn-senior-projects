The output of this project will be the foundation of an intelligent textbook for each student who participates.\u00a0 Students will gain a deep understanding of how to create high-quality prompts that extract precise knowledge from large-language models and store this information in an open format on GitHub with a textbook rendered on GitHub pages.\u00a0 No prior programming experience is required, but students must work with faculty that are subject-matter experts in a specific course.</p>"},{"location":"intelligent-textbooks-proposal/#details","title":"Details","text":"<p>We propose that one of the groups in the EECD Senior seminar build a series of \"Intelligent Textbooks\" using generative AI.\u00a0 Last year, we had two groups participate.\u00a0 One group built MicroSims and did hands-on work extending the AI Racing League to use the updated Raspberry Pi 4 computers.</p> <p>Since last year, generative AI has become much more capable of building out not just single labs or writing small Python programs; it has also been used to generate the foundations of Intelligent Textbooks, including: 1.
